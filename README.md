# Movie-Recommended-System
A movie recommendation system using Python and data science aims to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. This enhances user experience and engagement. The process involves data collection, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis. User-item interaction is represented in a matrix with ratings, enriched by features like genres and cast. Different recommendation algorithms like Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and Hybrid Methods are considered. The chosen algorithm is trained and evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error and cross-validation. The model is deployed with a user-friendly interface, allowing users to receive personalized movie suggestions. Continuous learning and user feedback improve recommendations over time. Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Streamlit facilitate the implementation of this iterative process.
